## Inspiration:

I was working on a freelance project for a well-known supermarket which had five branches across south India. The task there was completely different and it was more on analyzing each sales persons performance overall with sales associated with him and his / her performance according to the target. That experience gave me this idea about doing something related to supermarket but different from what I did so I chose to analyze the sales data in various ways grabbing as many insights as possible.
